These files are custom patches for the currently installed vexflow version.
They should be copied to ../../node_modules/vexflow/src/
This will be done by a pre-build script soon, but for now has to be done manually.

Currently, we are using Vexflow 1.2.93, because of some formatter advantages
compared to Vexflow 3.x versions.
Because of that, we need to patch in a few fixes that came after 1.2.93.

All the current fixes are already merged into the Vexflow repository.
